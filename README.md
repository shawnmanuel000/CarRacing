# Stanford CS248 Final Project: 3D Car Simulator with OpenGL

This is a 3D car simulator implemented in OpenGL.

## Build Instructions

In order to ease the process of running on different platforms, this project uses [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/). You will need a CMake installation of version 3.18+ to build the code. Currently only building in OSX or Linux is supported.

#### To build this on OS X or Linux:

```
$ cd CarRacing && mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Or if using VS Code, simple click on the debug tab, in the debug program list select 'Build' if on linux or 'Build OSX' if on Mac.
